The analysis file loads the audios and their sampling rates for already segmented vowel speech segments using montreal force alignment.

Then acoustic analysis is performed by
# varying time window
# varying frequency bins/mels/ceps
# varying feature type spec/melspec/cep

Feature importance is compared
within logfbank/mfcc


Results are saved as plots. 
You need to install following library for feature analysis

! pip install python_speech_features
